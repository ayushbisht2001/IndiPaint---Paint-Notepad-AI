# IndiPaint = Paint+Notepad+AI
Hello everyone , I have made this project on python using python's GUI module ie. Tkinter. 
This project is created with reference to Microsoft Paint and I  had implement most of its features.

# Features
1. We can draw rectangles , triangles , heart , star , polygon etc.
2. We can even add text to our drawing.
3. We have a variety of Paint brushes.
4. We can import images.
5. We can also directly print them.

Apart from all these features which we are using till now on Microsoft paint , here we have
1. a variety of designs which impart some 3D effects in our creation.
2. a text editor which can be easily switched in with a single click.
3. an AI system for speech to text conversion, this features comes with both hindi and english convertor plus threshold energy controller , which help us to customise 
the application according to surrounding noise.
