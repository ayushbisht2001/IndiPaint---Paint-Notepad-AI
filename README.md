Hello everyone , I have made this project on python using python's GUI module ie. Tkinter. 
This project is created with reference to Microsoft Paint and I  had implement most of its features.

Apart from all these features which we are using till now on Microsoft paint , here we have
1. a variety of designs which impart some 3D effects in our creation.
2. a text editor which can be easily switched in with a single click.
3. an AI system for speech to text conversion, this features comes with both hindi and english convertor plus threshold energy controller , which help us to customise 
the application according to surrounding noise.
