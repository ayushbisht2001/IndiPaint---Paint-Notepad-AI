Hello everyone , I have made this project on python using python's GUI library ie. Tkinter. 
This project is created with reference to Microsoft Paint and I  had implement most of its features.

Apart from all these features which we are using till now on Microsoft paint , here we have
1. a variety of designs which impart some 3D effects in our creation.
2. a text editor which can be easily switched on with a single click.
3. an AI system for speech to text conversion, this features comes with both hindi and english convertor plus threshold energy controller , which help us to customise 
the application according to surrounding noise.

I think this project gonna be a best thing for those who are neophyte in this field. It would really help the beginner to clear their concept on  widgets and modules of tkinter.

# Thank you all
happy coding .......
